To ensure the toggle button moves along with the sidebar when it collapses and expands, you'll need to position it using CSS so that its position is dependent on the width of the sidebar. The previous suggestion of positioning the button absolutely relative to the sidebar needs a slight adjustment so it moves with the sidebar.

Hereâ€™s how you can update your CSS to achieve this:

### Updated CSS

```css
.app {
  display: flex;
  height: 100vh;
}

.sidebar {
  background-color: #333;
  color: white;
  width: 200px;
  transition: width 0.3s;
  position: relative; /* Ensure this is set to contain the button */
}

.collapsed {
  width: 0;
  transition: width 0.3s;
}

.toggle-btn {
  position: absolute;
  right: 0; /* Align button to the right edge of the sidebar */
  transform: translateX(100%); /* Move it outside the sidebar */
  top: 10px;
  cursor: pointer;
  width: 40px;
  height: 40px;
  background-color: #666;
  color: white;
  border-radius: 5px;
  border: none;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}

.main {
  flex-grow: 1;
  background-color: #ccc;
  padding: 20px;
}

table {
  width: 100%;
  border-collapse: collapse;
}

table, th, td {
  border: 1px solid black;
}

th, td {
  padding: 8px;
  text-align: left;
}
```

### Key Changes

- **Position of Toggle Button**: The `toggle-btn` is now positioned absolutely with respect to its nearest positioned ancestor, which is the sidebar with `position: relative`. The `right: 0` will align the button to the right edge of the sidebar, and `transform: translateX(100%)` moves it just outside the sidebar.
- **Transition with Sidebar**: Because the button is now part of the sidebar (in terms of layout context), it will move along with the sidebar when its width changes due to the collapsing/expanding action.

With these changes, the button should correctly slide in and out with the sidebar. When you test your application by running `npm start`, the toggle button will appear to the right of the sidebar and will move left and right as the sidebar collapses and expands, respectively. This should give you the behavior you're looking for.
